Hi! My name is Przemek Wolnik and I&apos;m a frontend developer who lives and works in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland.

Why I wrote this blog? I wanted it to be:

1. A set of notes about topics that I thought were worth to learn. Notes that are always close at hand whenever I need them.
2. A good (I think) way to learn new things.
3. A record of my learning of Javascript and technologies related with programming.

Because of the above it would be fair to warn you that in the articles on this blog you may find many simplifications,
mental shortcuts and - which is inevitable in the process of learning - errors.

Having said that I hope you will find something interesting and valuable here and would like to visit my blog again.

You may check my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/przemwo) to see what I'm tinkering with right now.
